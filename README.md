## Description

      In this challenge, we were tasked to develop an API for a social network, using a NoSQL database, so the website can
      handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Installation

      Clone this repository to a folder on your device.
      Navigate to that folder and type 'run npm i' in the terminal to install all dependencies
      Type 'npm start' to run the app

NOTE: You must have node, express, moment and mongoose installed to run this app. Refer to the npm documentation for more details.

## Usage

      Type npm start

      The app can be accessed using Insomnia to demonstrate the routes. It is provided without seed data, so you will need to provide your own user data.
